# MOVEX Change Data Capture: Change data capture for relational databases

TriXX captures data change events (Insert/Update/Delete) in relational databases and immediately transfers the data changes to Kafka event hub.

TriXX is desided to become an open source project of OSP.

The decision is made, but some details need to be clarified before the release of the project.
We expect this to be resolved by early January 2022.
