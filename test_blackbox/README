Blackbox-Tests with MovexCdc Docker image and Kafka
================================================
Separate blackbox tests with resulting Docker image are necessary for Movex CDC because:
- Rails uses the same database connection for all threads created by Movex CDC (probably to ensure rollback to savepoint)
- MovexCdc uses multiple threads
- The cooperation of multiple threads (each event should only be processed by one thread) has therefore to be tested outside the Rails test suite
